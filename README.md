## Introduction

This repository is aimed at Python developers who want to understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each topic is explained with comments in code for better understanding.

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Efficient implementations for searching and sorting.
- **Linked Lists**: Single and doubly linked list implementations.
- **Stacks**: LIFO data structure with push and pop operations.
- **Queues**: FIFO data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Trees**: Binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs**: Implementations of graph algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS).
- **Hash Tables**: Efficient lookup using hash functions (with Python dictionaries).

## Algorithms

- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples like the Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem.
- **Greedy**: Greedy algorithm examples like the activity selection problem.
- **Backtracking**: Solving problems like the N-Queens problem.

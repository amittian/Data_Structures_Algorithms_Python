## Introduction

This repository is aimed at Python developers who want to understand and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each topic is explained with comments in code for better understanding.

## Data Structures

- **Lists**: Ordered collection, allows duplicate elements, mutable.
    - Examples: List manipulations, list comprehensions, and common list operations.
  
- **Tuples**: Ordered collection, allows duplicate elements, immutable.
    - Examples: Tuple unpacking, tuple slicing, and iteration over tuples.

- **Dictionaries (Dicts)**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, mutable.
    - Examples: Dictionary methods, handling collisions, and advanced dictionary usage.

- **Arrays**: Efficient implementations for searching and sorting.
    - Examples: Array creation and basic operations.

- **Linked Lists**: Single and doubly linked list implementations.
    - Examples: Inserting nodes, deleting nodes, traversing a linked list.

- **Stacks**: LIFO data structure with push and pop operations.
    - Examples: Implementing a stack using lists and linked lists.

- **Queues**: FIFO data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
    - Examples: Implementing queues with lists and linked lists.

- **Trees**: Binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
    - Examples: Tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

- **Graphs**: Implementations of graph algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS).
    - Examples: Graph traversal, shortest path algorithms.

- **Hash Tables**: Efficient lookup using hash functions (with Python dictionaries).
    - Examples: Handling hash collisions, dictionary-based implementations.

## Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: 
    - Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
  
- **Searching Algorithms**:
    - Binary Search, Linear Search.

- **Dynamic Programming**: 
    - Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.

- **Greedy Algorithms**:
    - Activity selection problem, Fractional Knapsack problem.

- **Backtracking**:
    - N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver.

## LeetCode Exercises

This section contains Python solutions to popular **LeetCode** problems categorized by difficulty:

- **Easy Problems**:
    - Problem 1: Two Sum
    - Problem 2: Reverse Linked List

- **Medium Problems**:
    - Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    - Problem 4: Add Two Numbers (Linked List)

- **Hard Problems**:
    - Problem 5: Merge k Sorted Lists
